# Data catalog for the MEDIATION project

Here you will find all the information on the data that have been (or are being) used in the MEDIATION project.

## What is going on

The MEDIATION project, which focuses on developing innovative and/or improved modelling tools, meets [the sixth challenge among the seven set out](PPR20210609_OCEANETCLIMAT_VF.pdf) by the french Priority Research Program (PPR) named 'Océan et Climat'. It consists in a large-scale, multidisciplinary, publicly-funded initiative, determined by 3 main goals :

1) To better understand and adapt to how the global ocean responds to the climate change, 
2) To maintain and develop a sustainable anthropic exploitation of oceanic resources,
3) To reduce ocean pollution.

More information about the Océan et Climat program is available [here](https://www.ocean-climat.fr/Le-PPR).
